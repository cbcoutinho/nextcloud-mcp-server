### Note Attachments

This server supports adding and retrieving note attachments via WebDAV. Please note the following behavior regarding attachments:

* When a note is deleted, its attachments remain in the system. This matches the behavior of the official Nextcloud Notes app.
* Orphaned attachments (attachments whose parent notes have been deleted) may accumulate over time.
* WebDAV permissions must be properly configured for attachment operations to work correctly.
