# Nextcloud MCP Server

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-ghcr.io/cbcoutinho/nextcloud--mcp--server-blue)](https://github.com/cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server/pkgs/container/nextcloud-mcp-server)

The Nextcloud MCP (Model Context Protocol) server allows Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude to interact with your Nextcloud instance. This enables automation of various Nextcloud actions, starting with the Notes API.

## Features

Currently, the server primarily interacts with the Nextcloud Notes API, providing tools and resources to manage notes.

### Available Tools

*   `nc_notes_create_note`: Create a new note.
*   `nc_notes_update_note`: Update an existing note by ID.
*   `nc_notes_delete_note`: Delete a note by ID.

### Available Resources

*   `notes://{note_id}`: Access a specific note by its ID.
*   `notes://all`: Access all notes.
*   `notes://settings`: Access note settings.
*   `nc://capabilities`: Access Nextcloud server capabilities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Access to a Nextcloud instance

### Local Installation

1.  Clone the repository (if running from source):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server.git
    cd nextcloud-mcp-server
    ```
2.  Install the package (if running as a library):
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

### Docker

A pre-built Docker image is available: `ghcr.io/cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server`

## Configuration

The server requires credentials to connect to your Nextcloud instance. Create a file named `.env` (or any name you prefer) in the directory where you'll run the server, based on the `env.sample` file:

```dotenv
# .env
NEXTCLOUD_HOST=https://your.nextcloud.instance.com
NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=your_nextcloud_username
NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD=your_nextcloud_app_password_or_login_password
```

*   `NEXTCLOUD_HOST`: The full URL of your Nextcloud instance.
*   `NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME`: Your Nextcloud username.
*   `NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD`: **Important:** It is highly recommended to use a dedicated Nextcloud App Password for security. You can generate one in your Nextcloud Security settings. Alternatively, you can use your regular login password, but this is less secure.

## Running the Server

### Locally

Ensure your environment variables are loaded, then run the server using `mcp run`:

```bash
# Load environment variables from your .env file
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)

# Run the server
mcp run --transport sse nextcloud_mcp_server.server:mcp
```

The server will start, typically listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

### Using Docker

Mount your environment file when running the container:

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 --env-file .env --rm ghcr.io/cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server:latest
```

This will start the server and expose it on port 8000 of your local machine.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can connect to it using an MCP client like `uvx`. Add the server to your `uvx` configuration:

```bash
uvx mcp add nextcloud-mcp http://localhost:8000 --default-transport sse
```

You can then interact with the server's tools and resources through your LLM interface connected to `uvx`.
